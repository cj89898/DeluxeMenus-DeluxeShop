# DeluxeMenus-DeluxeShop

This shop is fully configurable and very easy to add items to!

Setup:
1. Go through and add all the files here. For config files you should edit them and add to them or else you'll have to redo your other menus/placeholders.
2. Download the following expansions via `/papi ecloud download <expansion>`. `checkitem`, `javascript`, `player`, `string`, `math`.
3. Items can be added via the `dmshop-items_data.yml` file found in `PlaceholderAPI/javascripts/javascript_data`. Default has stone set up as item 1.
4. The selling can be changed. You can set it to `individual` to have a sell price per item, OR you can use a number such as `0.4` to have a multiplier based off the buy price.
